    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The ultimate asian inspired burger, using ramen noodles as buns! This burger is not only delicious, but fun & creative, and surprisingly easy to prepare!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 vegan egg, such as Bob’s Red Mill- or you can use one flax egg in replacement (I made the consistency a bit more runny, so I added an extra teaspoon of water to my egg mixture.)</li>
        <li>2 blocks of Gluten Free Ramen, such as Lotus Foods</li>
        <li>1 TBS + 2 tsp avocado oil (or any oil you prefer), divided</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 TBS each - white sesame seeds, black sesame seeds, fried garlic (I buy it from the Asian store. If you can’t find fried garlic, you definitely don’t have to add it.)</li>
        <li>2 vegan burger patties - I used Beyond Meat</li>
        <li>Cucumber, thinly sliced</li>
        
    </ul>
