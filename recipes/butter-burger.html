    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m no stranger to a good burger, or any burger really, but a good burger and I get along like peas and carrots, especially a buttery burger. Enter the butter burger. These juicy and savory burgers are perfect for a weeknight dinner, neighborhood cookout, or the big game tailgate.</p>
    <p>Much like this ridiculously good smokehouse burger, the topping for these burgers is all about choice, but a slice of cheese is almost mandatory. I personally like some grilled onions on a butter burger as well, and occasionally some bacon jam.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs ground beef, 80/20 fat to lean ratio</li>
        <li>1 stick unsalted butter, frozen</li>
        <li>1 medium vidalia onion, sliced</li>
        <li>14 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Buns (I use onion buns)</li>
    </ul>
